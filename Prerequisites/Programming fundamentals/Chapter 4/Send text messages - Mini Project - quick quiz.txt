1. What is a class?
A class is kind of like a blueprint.


2. What is an instance of a class?
It's like a copy of the original class, which we store in a variable.
By using this copy we now have access to information and functions available whithin that class.


3. Thus far we have compared the class to a blueprint.
   Can you think of another analogy to explain classes?
